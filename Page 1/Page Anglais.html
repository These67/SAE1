        <h3>Why did i join the BUT RT?</h3>

                    I joined the BUT Networks and Telecoms because i have always been interested in electrical
                    engineering and computing. My grandfather was an electrical engineering teacher and my father is a
                    laser technician. I have been immersed in electrical engineering since i was a child. In collège, i
                    lost interest. Then, in seconde of lycée, i got interested again and discovered programming in
                    Python and C. At the same time, i did some basic electrical assembly with my grandfather. In the
                    same year i did a voluntary internship at the Elektronikzentrum of the Bundeswehr in Bad Bergzabern.
                    I went into STI2D and got really interested. Then i decided to apply to the BUT RT because i was
                    very interested in cyber security and there was both electrical engineering and computer science,
                    which i prefer.

                    Personal objectives:
                    My goals are to succeed in my professional objectives but also to pass my diploma of mountain
                    leader. I would also like to do some long hikes like Santiago de Compostela or the GR20. I would
                    also like to climb the El Capitan cliff in Yosemite Park in the USA.
                    Professional goals:
                    My first goal is to join the ICS. Then either to join an engineering school with a specialization in
                    cybersecurity or to enter the working world.
